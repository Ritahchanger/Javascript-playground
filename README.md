```


1. **To-Do List App**
   - This project showcases the basics of task management using vanilla JavaScript.
   - Two versions exist: one that stores tasks in memory (`todoApp`), and another using `localStorage` to persist tasks (`Todo2`).

2. **Debouncing Example**
   - Demonstrates how to debounce events like `scroll` or `input` to improve performance by limiting function calls.

3. **LeetCode Challenges**
   - Examples include algorithms for searching arrays, finding unique elements, majority elements, and working with strings (palindromes, anagrams, etc.).

## 🚀 Features 


- **LeetCode Challenges**: Solutions to common coding problems found on platforms like LeetCode, including algorithms for searching, sorting, dynamic programming, and more.
- **JavaScript Projects**: Small-scale projects built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Examples include to-do list apps, debouncing examples, and more.
- **Problem-Solving**: Classic algorithm and data structure problems, including factorials, palindrome checkers, array manipulations, etc.
- **Framework Integration**: Occasional use of JavaScript frameworks to test out various tools and enhance skills with different libraries and frameworks.
