# React State Management with Redux Toolkit and useContext

## Overview
This project is a work-in-progress that focuses on implementing state management in a React application using two approaches: **Redux Toolkit** and **useContext**. The goal is to explore and compare these two methods for managing application state in different scenarios.

## Features (Planned)
- Use of **Redux Toolkit** to handle global state management in a scalable way.
- Integration of **useContext** for lightweight state management and sharing of global data.
- Example components showcasing how both approaches can be used within a React project.
- Demonstration of how to integrate asynchronous actions with Redux.

## Technologies
- React
- Redux Toolkit
- useContext
- JavaScript (ES6+)
